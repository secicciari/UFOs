# UFOs

## Project Overview

### Purpose of Analysis
Dana has asked me to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape (in addition to the date that we already built out) in order to allow users to filter by multiple criteria to do a more in-depth analysis with the UFO sighting data on her webpage.

## Results

### Overview
When someone visits the webpage, they can use the forms on the left hand side of the screen to filter the list of UFO sightings. </br>
In order to use the filters, the person can type the specific criteria they're looking for in the text box and press "Enter". This will update the list of UFO sightings to show only those that match the search. </br>
They can also use multiple filters at the same time, as shown in the screenshot below. </br>

To clear the current search, the user can delete the existing text and press "Enter". This will refresh the list. </br>

## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback of this design is that a site user can't select multiple things to filter on within one filter. For example, I can't search for Triangle shape in OR, IL, or CA all at once.

### Recommendations
1. To address the drawback I mentioned above, I would recommend allowing multiple criteria to be entered within each form so that the search expereicne could be further customized. 
2. To build on this, I would also add a drop down for each form that includes the valid options. For example, the "state" form would not accept freely entered text but rather would have a drop down there the viewer could select the state(s) they are interested in.
